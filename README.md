# Acolyte

A procedurally generated RPG inspired by Rogue and written in Pony.

This is a work in progress but you can currently play complete games.
Because everything is procedurally generated, it's a different game
every time.

NOTE: Acolyte is currently tested with ponyc v0.20.0. It may break
with earlier or later ponyc releases.

## Installation

Currently, Acolyte is only supported on OSX, though it should work on at least 
some Linux distros.

### Install via homebrew

Installing via homebrew is easy. Just run the following commands:
```
brew tap jtfmumm/tap
brew install acolyte
```

### Building on Mac OS X

If you don't use homebrew or you'd rather build from source, you can follow
these instructions. You'll need to install the Pony compiler as part of this
process.

#### Building ponyc
You'll need llvm 3.7.1 or 3.8.1 and the pcre2 library to build Pony. You can use either homebrew or MacPorts to install these dependencies.

##### Get Dependencies via Homebrew
Installation via [homebrew](http://brew.sh):
```
$ brew update
$ brew install homebrew/versions/llvm38 pcre2 libressl
```

##### Get Dependencies via MacPorts
Installation via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org):
```
$ sudo port install llvm-3.8 pcre2 libressl
$ sudo port select --set llvm mp-llvm-3.8
```

##### Install compiler
Clone the ponyc repo and install the compiler (Acolyte is tested with ponyc 
v0.14.0):
```
git clone https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc
cd ponyc
git checkout 0.14.0
make config=release install
```

#### Building Acolyte
```
git clone https://github.com/jtfmumm/acolyte
cd acolyte
ponyc
chmod +x acolyte
```

## Running
Your terminal must have dimensions of at least 99x31 to run the game properly. 

Assuming you've set execute permissions (e.g. via `chmod +x acolyte`), you can run the game with the following command:
```
./acolyte
```
